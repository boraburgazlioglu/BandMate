# BandMate -Sabanci University - CS310 - Term Project

## Project Description:

BandMate is a mobile application designed for bands to manage their rehearsals, gigs, songwriting progress, and finances in one shared platform. It provides a platform for bands where each member can enter their personal availability, automatically suggesting optimal rehearsal times. Also providing a list of formerly played and potentially playable songs, which band members can interact with by toggling a button for each song that they are personally ready to play. Another feature of the app is an “Expenses” section where each member can enter their personal expenses related to the band for the app to calculate how much money members owe to each other. The last core feature the app offers is a gig management page where users can see the info of their upcoming gigs. Optionally, a “comment” feature for setlists, each song in the setlist, gigs, and rehearsals and a voting feature to decide the location of the next rehearsal, would be some nice-to-have extensions.
